# What is acl in S3?
- acl stands for Access Control List.
- It is a way of defining who can access your S3 bucket and what actions they can perform. AWS provides predefined ACLs like:
- "private" → Owner has full control, no one else has access (default and most secure).
- "public-read" → Anyone on the internet can read objects in the bucket.
- "public-read-write" → Anyone can read and write (not recommended, security risk).
- "authenticated-read" → Any AWS authenticated user can read objects.

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.example]

  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  acl    = "private"
}
