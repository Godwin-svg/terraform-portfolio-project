# Terraform Next.js Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
A client developed a modern, responsive single-page portfolio website using **Next.js**. The website required hosting on a **reliable, scalable, cost-effective platform** with global availability and fast loading speeds.

I successfully **deployed the Next.js portfolio website on AWS** using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform**, ensuring automation, scalability, and high performance.
